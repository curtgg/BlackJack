Instructions:
To run the program you must have the pygame module installed. This can be installed
through the pip installer for python. Once that has been done, run the game by
executing "python MainGUI.py" from the command line in the directory that contains the
files. This will open up the game and allow you to begin playing.

From the title screen you are able to access the options menu, which allows you to
set various settings for the game such as, number of players, bots, decks, starting
money, and card count display. The number of players and bots is capped at 5
because of the size of the table. When you begin the game it will be launched with
the selected options, with the players laid out on the board as so:
                              4   dealer   5
                                2         3
                                     1
The players always take their turns before the AI and also they are set ahead of
the players on the board, so the AI will always be the last players to take their
turn. Rounds are sequenced as so: All players make theirs bets, then are dealt their
first 2 cards, after that the dealer places his first card and then the players all
take their turns in order(hit, stand, etc) when they are finished, the dealer put down
his remaining cards till he is finished.

Problems:
No real issues but it is not completely evident when playing with multiple human players
who's turn it is. we had planned to have an indicator but ran out of time. You will know
for sure that it is a players turn when the program waits and doesn't proceed, and can
easily keep track of whos turn it is mentally. I have left the print statements to the
console on just incase.
